# Javascript Console Hacks
This folder contains various javascript scripts that can be run from the Chrome javascript console (or similar browser interface).

# Usage
* Login to Turbonomic using Chrome
* Click on View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console
* Copy/paste the contents of the given javascript file into the console.
* In some cases the script will autorun. In others, the script will have different options so you'll need to call the main routine. The script will show you the usage when you paste it in.
